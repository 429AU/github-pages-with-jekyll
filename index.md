I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

As previously explained, this chapter contains material that is needed for the student to 
understand Part B (and start his or her team-based term project), without covering Part A. 

The material in this chapter has been kept to a bare minimum, because the broader issues 
will be discussed when the instructor has completed Part B and then teaches Part A. 

There are no references in this summary chapter, nor are its contents indexed. Instead, 
there are footnotes connecting each section in this chapter to the corresponding section(s) 
in Part A, should further information be needed.
